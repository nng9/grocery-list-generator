# Grocery List Generator

## Problem
I waste time grocery shopping because I do not know exactly how many ingredients I need for the week.

## Solution
This program stores recipes and allows users create shopping lists by adding recipes to them. By doing this, the user can know exactly which ingredients to buy at the store. 

## Implementation
This desktop application written in Python and uses the PySide6 library.

## TODO
- Build out the shopping list tab
- Add an Import/Export Tab
- Implement email library which allows users to share shopping lists or recipes with email
